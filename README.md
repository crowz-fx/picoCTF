# Pico CTF
Lui's solutions to picoCTF challenges, see [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) for more info

## Notes
- The way picoCTF works is the challenges in the events and playlists can be re-used, so some places will have symlinks to another folder of where that instance was completed, git shows them as symlinks and the file contents is the target
